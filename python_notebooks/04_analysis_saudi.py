# ### ðŸ“Š Distribution of Categorical Values
# 
# This code block computes the **frequency distribution** of values in a specific column. It's particularly useful for identifying the **most common categories**, such as top employers, cities, or job titles.

# Key Insight:
# - This helps us **identify dominant categories** which could indicate market leaders or preferred locations.

# ## Top 10 Industries by Number of Job Postings
# 
# This section visualizes the top 10 industries (represented by company names) with the most job postings using a horizontal bar plot. Instead of using basic `matplotlib`, we use **Seaborn** for enhanced styling and better visual clarity.
# 
# ### Step-by-step:
# - **Step 1**: Count the number of job postings per company.
# - **Step 2**: Take the top 10 companies and sort them for horizontal alignment.
# - **Step 3**: Use `sns.barplot` to create a horizontal bar chart with a clean palette.
# - **Step 4**: Add labels, title, and styling for clarity.
