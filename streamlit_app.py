            ### 1. **Initial Column Splitting**
               - **Location**: Extracted `city` by splitting the `location` column using the separator `·`.
               - **Career Level**: Divided `career_level` into `type`, `exp`, and `no_exp` columns.
            
            ### 2. **Handling Missing Values**
               - Replaced "Unknown" values in `exp` and `no_exp` with `NaN`.
               - Combined similar columns (`experience` & `exp`, `num_of_exp` & `no_exp`) into new columns (`experience_`, `num_of_exp_years`).
               - Filled missing values in categorical columns (`remote`, `age`, `sex`, etc.) with default values like "لا تفضيل" (no preference).
            
            ### 3. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**
               - Removed irrelevant columns such as `age`, `salary`, `qualification`, and others that were not needed for analysis.
            
            ### 4. **Standardizing Job Titles**
               - Removed leading numbers, periods, and unwanted terms (e.g., "sr", "junior") from job titles.
               - Mapped job titles to standardized names using predefined mappings.
            
            ### 5. **Manual Adjustments and Translation**
               - Manually cleaned and translated the `title` column for consistency.
               - Removed rows containing specific keywords like "سعودية", "saudi".
            
            ### 6. **Updating Experience Information**
               - Updated rows where `type` included "تدريب" to set `experience_` to "خريج جديد" (New Graduate).
            
            ### 7. **Extracting Additional Information**
               - Extracted gender and remote work information from text columns (`title`, `description`, `skills`).
            
            ### 8. **Final Adjustments**
               - Dropped unnecessary columns like `description` and `skills`.
               - Processed and cleaned the `num_of_exp_years` column."""
