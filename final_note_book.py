# 2. **Translation**:
#    - Translated 'experience_', 'type', 'sex', and 'remote' using respective translation functions.
# 
# 3. **Gender Extraction**:
#    - Extracted gender information from 'title', 'description', and 'skills'.
# 
# 4. **Remote Work Extraction**:
#    - Extracted remote work information from 'title', 'description', and 'skills'.
# 
# 5. **Drop Irrelevant Columns**:
#    - Dropped 'description' and 'skills' columns.
# 
# 6. **Split 'num_of_exp_years' Column**:
#    - Split and processed the 'num_of_exp_years' column.

# 
# 2. **Remove Leading "a"**:
#    - Removed any instance of the letter "a" at the beginning of the title followed by a space.
# 
# 3. **Convert to Lowercase**:
#    - Converted all titles to lowercase for consistency.
# 
# 4. **Sort Titles**:
#    - Sorted the titles alphabetically in ascending order.

# ### Job Title Cleaning Process
# 
# 1. **Pattern Replacement**:
#    - Applied a regular expression pattern to remove unwanted terms like "sr", "ssr", "senior", "junior", "staff", gender-related terms (e.g., "male", "female"), and specific job rank indicators (e.g., "trainee", "graduate").
#    - Cleaned up job titles to ensure they follow the correct format without extra symbols, spaces, or unnecessary words.
# 
# 2. **Title Editing**:
#    - Applied a predefined title mapping (`edite_title_mapping`) to standardize job titles, ensuring consistency across the dataset (e.g., "cashier" becomes "cashier", "driller" becomes "drilling operator").
# 
# 3. **Save the Data**:
#    - The cleaned titles were saved back into the database for further analysis, ensuring all records follow the standardized format.

# ### **Plot 1: Top 10 Cities by Number of Jobs (Egypt)**
# 
# #### **Description**
# - This bar chart shows the top 10 cities in Egypt based on the number of jobs available.
# - The x-axis represents the names of the cities, while the y-axis represents the number of jobs.
# - The cities are listed from left to right in descending order of job availability.
# 
# #### **Key Observations**
# 1. **Cairo** has the highest number of jobs, with over 2,000 jobs, making it the dominant city.
# 2. **Alexandria** follows as the second city with approximately 100 jobs.
# 3. Other cities such as **New Cairo**, **Sharm El-Sheikh**, **Matrouh**, **Aswan**, **Luxor**, **Giza**, and **Suez** have very low job availability, with most having fewer than 50 jobs.
# 
# #### **Meaning**
# - Cairo is the capital and largest city in Egypt, serving as the country's political, economic, and cultural center, which explains its high job availability.
# - Alexandria, as the second-largest city, offers some job opportunities but is far behind Cairo.
# - Smaller cities like Sharm El-Sheikh, Matrouh, and Aswan have minimal job opportunities, likely due to their smaller populations and more specialized economies (e.g., tourism).
# 
# ---
# 
# ### **Plot 2: Top 10 Cities by Number of Jobs (Saudi Arabia)**
# 
# #### **Description**
# - This bar chart shows the top 10 cities in Saudi Arabia based on the number of jobs available.
# - The x-axis represents the names of the cities, while the y-axis represents the number of jobs.
# - The cities are listed from left to right in descending order of job availability.
# 
# #### **Key Observations**
# 1. **Riyadh** has the highest number of jobs, significantly outperforming other cities with over 2,000 jobs.
# 2. **Jeddah** follows as the second city with approximately 500 jobs.
# 3. **Dammam**, **Khobar**, and **Sharqia** have moderate numbers of jobs, ranging from 100 to 300.
# 4. The remaining cities (**Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah**, **Qatif**, **Jizan**, **Tabuk**, and **Makkah**) have relatively low job availability, with most having fewer than 100 jobs.
# 
# #### **Meaning**
# - Riyadh is the economic and political hub of Saudi Arabia, which explains its dominance in job availability.
# - Jeddah, being a major port city and financial center, also offers a substantial number of jobs.
# - Smaller cities like Qatif, Jizan, and Tabuk have limited job opportunities, likely due to their size and economic focus.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### **Comparison Between the Two Plots**
# 
# #### **Similarities**
# 1. **Dominance of Capital Cities**:
#    - In both countries, the capital cities (Riyadh for Saudi Arabia and Cairo for Egypt) have the highest number of jobs, highlighting their central role in the economy.
# 2. **Skewed Distribution**:
#    - Both plots show a highly skewed distribution, where a few cities dominate job availability, while the majority have very low numbers.
# 3. **Economic Hubs**:
#    - Major economic hubs (e.g., Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Alexandria in Egypt) offer significant job opportunities but are still far behind the capital cities.
# 
# #### **Differences**
# 1. **Second-Largest City Job Availability**:
#    - In Saudi Arabia, Jeddah offers around 500 jobs, which is a substantial number.
#    - In Egypt, Alexandria offers only about 100 jobs, indicating a much lower secondary hub compared to Saudi Arabia.
# 2. **Overall Job Distribution**:
#    - Saudi Arabia has a broader distribution of jobs across multiple cities (e.g., Dammam, Khobar, Sharqia), whereas Egypt's job market is heavily centralized in Cairo.
# 3. **Smaller Cities**:
#    - In Saudi Arabia, smaller cities like Qatif, Jizan, and Tabuk still have some job availability, albeit low.
#    - In Egypt, smaller cities like Sharm El-Sheikh, Matrouh, and Aswan have almost negligible job opportunities.
# 
# #### **Conclusion**
# - Both Saudi Arabia and Egypt exhibit a strong concentration of jobs in their capital cities, reflecting their economic and political significance.
# - However, Saudi Arabia shows a slightly more diversified job market across multiple cities, while Egypt's job market is heavily centralized in Cairo, with minimal opportunities elsewhere.

# 5. Smaller companies like **RAWAJ**, **Delivery Hero SE**, **ElsewedyElectric**, and **Tagaddod** have relatively low job availability, with most having fewer than 50 jobs.
# 
# #### **Meaning**
# - **Talent 360** appears to be a major player in the Egyptian job market, possibly due to its focus on recruitment or staffing services.
# - Companies like **SSC - Egypt** and **Vodafone - Egypt** are significant employers, reflecting the importance of technology and telecommunications in Egypt's economy.
# - The presence of international brands (e.g., Vodafone) and local companies (e.g., Giza Systems) highlights a diverse job market.

# 5. Smaller companies like **Arthur Lawrence**, **WorleyParsons**, **Giza Arabia**, and **Ash International** have relatively low job availability, with most having fewer than 50 jobs.
# 
# #### **Meaning**
# - **Saudi Aramco**, being one of the largest oil companies globally and a major employer in Saudi Arabia, dominates the job market.
# - Companies like **InterContinental Hotels Group** and **Jobs for Humanity** also play significant roles in providing employment opportunities.
# - The presence of international companies (e.g., Bechtel Corporation) indicates a mix of local and global businesses contributing to the job market.
# - Smaller companies have limited job offerings, reflecting a more fragmented job market outside the top employers.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### **Comparison Between the Two Plots**
# 
# #### **Similarities**
# 1. **Dominance of Leading Employers**:
#    - In both countries, a few leading companies dominate the job market. For example, **Saudi Aramco** in Saudi Arabia and **Talent 360** in Egypt have significantly higher job counts compared to other companies.
# 2. **Skewed Distribution**:
#    - Both plots show a highly skewed distribution, where a few companies offer the majority of jobs, while the rest have relatively low job availability.
# 3. **Presence of International Companies**:
#    - Both countries have international companies (e.g., Bechtel Corporation in Saudi Arabia and Vodafone in Egypt) contributing to the job market.
# 
# #### **Differences**

#    - Egypt has a more concentrated job market, with a few large employers (e.g., Talent 360, SSC - Egypt) dominating, while smaller companies have very limited job availability.
# 3. **Smaller Companies**:
#    - In Saudi Arabia, smaller companies like **Arthur Lawrence** and **WorleyParsons** still have some job availability, albeit low.
#    - In Egypt, smaller companies like **RAWAJ** and **Delivery Hero SE** have almost negligible job opportunities, indicating a more fragmented job market.
# 
# #### **Conclusion**
# - Both Saudi Arabia and Egypt exhibit a strong concentration of jobs in a few leading companies, reflecting their economic significance.
# - However, Saudi Arabia shows a slightly more diversified job market across multiple companies, while Egypt's job market is heavily centralized in a few large employers, with minimal opportunities elsewhere.

# ### **Plot 1: Job Distribution by Work Type (Egypt)**
# 
# #### **Description**
# - This pie chart shows the distribution of job types based on work arrangements in Egypt.
# - The chart is divided into three segments:
#   - **On-site**: Jobs that require physical presence at a workplace.
#   - **Remote**: Jobs that can be performed entirely from a remote location.
#   - **Hybrid**: Jobs that combine both on-site and remote work.
# 
# #### **Key Observations**
# 1. **On-site** jobs dominate the distribution, accounting for **86.5%** of the total jobs.
# 2. **Remote** jobs make up **9.9%** of the total jobs.
# 3. **Hybrid** jobs have the smallest share, representing only **3.6%** of the total jobs.
# 
# #### **Meaning**
# - The overwhelming majority of jobs in Egypt are **on-site**, indicating that most employers prefer or require employees to work physically at a workplace.
# - **Remote** jobs represent a small but notable portion of the job market, suggesting some flexibility in work arrangements but not as prevalent as on-site roles.
