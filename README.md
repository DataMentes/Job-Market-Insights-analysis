# Project Guidelines

Welcome to the project! To ensure smooth collaboration and avoid confusion, please follow these rules when working on this repository:

## 1. Organize Your Work

- Create a folder named `notebooks` in the root directory.
- Place all Jupyter Notebook files `.ipynb` that you are working on inside the `notebooks` folder.

## 2. Sync Before Starting

Before you begin working, always pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## 3. Convert Python Files to Jupyter Notebooks

If you need to work on a Python file `.py`, convert it to a Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` first:

1. Move the Python file to the `notebooks` folder.
2. Open it as a Jupyter Notebook.

## 4. Save Your Work Back to Python

After finishing your work in the Jupyter Notebook, convert it back to a Python file `.py`:

1. Convert the notebook to a Python file.
2. Return the Python file to its original location in the `python_notebooks` folder.

## 5. Commit Your Changes

Once your work is complete, stage and commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

## 6. Sync Again

Before pushing your changes, pull the latest updates from the remote repository to ensure no new changes have been made by others:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## 7. Push Your Changes

Finally, push your committed changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

**Important Notes:**

- Always follow this workflow to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency.
- If you encounter any issues during the process, communicate with the team immediately.
